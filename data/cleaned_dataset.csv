" What is Bitcoin mining? Bitcoin operates as a peer-to-peer network. This means that everyone who uses Bitcoin is a tiny fraction of the bank of Bitcoin. But where do Bitcoins come from? With paper money, a government decides when to print a distribute money. Bitcoin doesn't have a central government. With Bitcoin, miners use special software to solve math problems and are issued a certain number of Bitcoins in exchange. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine. And since miners are required to approve Bitcoin transactions, more miners means a more secure network. The Bitcoin network automatically changes the difficulty of the math problems, depending on how fast they're being solved. In the early days, Bitcoin miners solve these math problems with the processors and their computers. Soon, miners discover that graphics cards used for gaming were much better suited to this kind of math. Graphics cards are faster, but they use more electricity and generate a lot of heat. The first commercial Bitcoin mining products included chips that were reprogrammed for mining Bitcoin. These chips were faster, but still power hungry. ASIC or application-specific integrated circuit chips are designed specifically for Bitcoin mining. ASIC technology has made Bitcoin mining even faster while using less power. As the popularity of Bitcoin increases, more miners join the network, making it more difficult for individuals to solve the math problems. To overcome this, miners have developed a way to work together in pools. Pools of miners find solutions faster than their individual members, and each miner is rewarded proportionate to the amount of work he or she provides. Mining is an important and integral part of Bitcoin that ensures fairness while keeping the Bitcoin network stable, safe, and secure.

" Okay, so hello everyone. I'm Sam and I just turned 17. A few years ago before my freshman year in high school, I wanted to play snare drum in the Foxborough High School marching band. However, and it was a dream that I just had to accomplish, but each snare drum and harness weighed about 40 pounds each and I have a disease called progeria so just to give you an idea I weigh about only 50 pounds. So logistically I really couldn't carry a regular sized snare drum and because of this, the band director assigned me to play pit percussion during the halftime show. Now pit percussion was fun. It involved some really cool auxiliary percussion instruments like the bongos, timpani and timballes and cowbell. So it was fun, but it involved no marching and I was just so devastated. However, nothing was going to stop me from playing snare drum with the marching band in the halftime show. So my family and I worked with an engineer to design a snare drum harness that would be lighter and easier for me to carry. And so after continuous work, we made a snare drum apparatus that weighs only about six pounds. I'm just going to give you some more information about progeria. It affects only about 350 kids today worldwide. So it's pretty rare and effects of progeria include tight skin, lack of it gain, stinted growth and heart disease. Last year, my mom and her team of scientists published the first successful progeria treatment study and because of this, I was interviewed on NPR and John Hamilton asked me the question, what is the most important thing that people should know about you? My answer was simply that I have a very happy life. So even though there are many obstacles in my life with a lot of them being created by progeria, I don't want people to feel bad for me. I don't think about these obstacles all the time and I'm able to overcome most of them anyway. So I'm here today to share with you my philosophy for a happy life. So for me, there are three aspects to this philosophy. So this is a quote from the famous Ferris Bueller, the first aspect to my philosophy is that I'm okay with what I ultimately can't do because there's so much that I can do. Now people sometimes ask me questions like, isn't it hard living with progeria or what daily challenges are progeria do you face? And I'd like to say that even though I have progeria, most of my time is spent thinking about things that have nothing to do with progeria at all. Now this doesn't mean that I ignore the negative aspects of these obstacles. When I can't do something like run along distance or go on an intense roller coaster, you know, I know what I'm missing out on. But instead, I choose to focus on the activities that I can do through things that I'm passionate about like scouting or music or comic books or any of my favorite Boston sports teams. Yeah. So, however, sometimes I need to find a different way to do something by making adjustments. And I want to put those things in the can-do category kind of like you saw with the drum earlier. So, here's a clip with me playing Spider-Man with the Foxboro High School marching band at half time a couple of years ago. Yeah. Thank you. All right, all right. So, that was pretty cool. And so, I was able to accomplish my dream of playing snare drum with the marching band as I believe I can do for all of my dreams. So, hopefully, you can accomplish your dreams as well with this outlook. Next aspect to my philosophy is that I surround myself with people that I want to be with, people of high quality. I'm extremely lucky to have an amazing family who have always supported me throughout my entire life. And I'm also really fortunate to have a really close group of friends at school. Now, we're kind of goofy. A lot of us are band yeeks, but we really enjoy each other's company and we help each other out when we need to. We see each other for who we are on the inside. So, this is us goofing off a little bit. And so, we're juniors in high school now. And we can now mentor younger band members as a single collective unit. What I love about being in a group like the band is that the music that we make together is true, it's genuine, and it supersedes perjury. So, I don't have to worry about that when I'm feeling so good about making music. But even having made a documentary, going on TV a couple times, I feel like I'm at my highest point, when I'm with the people that surround me every day. They provide the real positive influences in my life as I hope that I can provide a positive influence in theirs as well. Thank you. So, the bottom line here is that I hope that you appreciate and love your family, love your friends for you guys, love your bros, and acknowledge your mentors and your community because they are a very real aspect of everyday life that can make a truly significant positive impact. So, the third aspect to the philosophy is keep moving forward. Here's a quote by a man you may know, in Walt Disney, and it's one of my favorite quotes. I always try to have something to look forward to. Something to strive for to make my life richer. It doesn't have to be big. It could be anything from looking forward to the next comic book to come out or going on a large family vacation or hanging out with my friends to go into the next high school football game. However, all of these things keep me focused to know that there's a bright future ahead and may get me through some difficult times that I may be having. Now, this mentality includes staying in a forward thinking state of mind. I try hard not to waste energy feeling badly for myself because when I do, I get stuck in a paradox where there's no room for any happiness or any other emotion. Now, it's not that I ignore what I'm feeling badly. I kind of accept it. I let it in so that I can acknowledge it and do what I need to do to move past it. When I was younger, I wanted to be an engineer. I wanted to be an inventor who would catapult the world into a better future. Maybe this came from my love of Legos and the freedom of expression that I felt when I was building with them. And these was also derived from my family and my mentors who always make me feel whole and good about myself. Now, today, my ambitions have changed a little bit. I'd like to go into the field of biology, maybe cell biology or genetics or biochemistry or really anything. And this is a friend of mine who I look up to, Francis Collins, the director of the NIH. And this is us at Ted Med last year, chatting away. I feel that no matter what I choose to become, I believe that I can change the world. And as I'm striving to change the world, I will be happy. About four years ago, HBO began to film a documentary about my family and me called Life According to Sam. Now, it was a pretty great experience, but it was also four years ago. And like anyone, my views on many things have changed and hopefully matured like my potential career choice. However, some things have stayed the same throughout that time, like my mentality and philosophy towards life. So I would like to show you a clip of my younger self from the film that I feel embodies that philosophy. I know more about it genetically. So it's less of an embodiment now. It used to be like this thing that prevents me from doing all this stuff that causes other kids to die, that causes everybody to be stressed. And now it's a protein that is abnormal that weakens the structure of cells. And it takes a burden off of me because now I don't have to think about the pringuria as an entity. Okay, pretty good, huh? Thank you. So as you can see, I've been thinking this way for many years, but I'd never really had to apply all of these aspects of my philosophy to the test at one time until last January. I was pretty sick. I had a chest cold and I was in the hospital for a few days. But and I was secluded from all of the aspects of my life that I felt made me, me, that kind of gave me my identity. But knowing that I was going to get better and looking forward to a time that I would feel good again helped me to keep moving forward. And sometimes I had to be brave. And it wasn't always easy. Sometimes I faltered, I had bad days, but I realized that being brave isn't supposed to be easy. And for me, I feel it's the key way to keep moving forward. So all in all, I don't waste energy feeling bad for myself. I surround myself with people that I want to be with and I keep moving forward. So with this philosophy, I hope that all of you, regardless of your obstacles, can have a very happy life as well. Oh wait, hang on a sec. One more piece of advice. Never miss a party if you can help it. My school's homecoming dance is tomorrow night and I will be there. Thank you very much.",philosophy,okay hello everyone I m sam turn year ago freshman year high school want play snare drum foxborough high school marching band however dream accomplish snare drum

" Hi, everyone. Two years ago, my life changed forever. My wife Kelsey and I welcomed our daughter Lila into the world. Now becoming a parent is an amazing, amazing experience. Your whole world changes overnight and all of your priorities change immediately. So fast that it makes it really difficult to process sometimes. Now you also have to learn a tremendous amount about being a parent, like for example, how to dress your child. This was new to me. This is an actual outfit. I thought this was a good idea. Even Lila knows that it's not a good idea. So there was so much to learn and so much craziness all at once. And to add to the craziness, Kelsey and I both work from home. We're entrepreneurs. We run our own businesses. So Kelsey is a developed courses online for yoga teachers. I'm an author. And so I'm working for home. Kelsey is working for home. We have an infant and we're trying to make sure that everything gets done, that needs done. And life is really, really, really busy. And a couple of weeks into this amazing experience, when the sleep deprivation really kicked in like around a week, eight, I had this thought and it was the same thought that parents crossed the ages internationally. Everybody has had this thought, which is, I am never going to have free time ever again. And somebody said it's true. Yeah, it's not exactly true, but it feels really, really true in that moment. And this was really disconcerting to me because one of the things that I enjoy more than anything else is learning new things, getting curious about something and diving in and fiddling around and learning through trial and error and eventually becoming pretty good at something. And without this free time, I didn't know how I was ever going to do that ever again. And so I'm a big geek. I want to keep learning things. I want to keep growing. And so what I decided to do was go to the library and go to the bookstore and look at what research says about how we learn and how we learn quickly. And I read a bunch of books, I read a bunch of websites and trying to answer this question, how long does it take to acquire a new skill? You know what I found? 10,000 hours. Anybody ever heard this? 10,000, it takes 10,000 hours. If you want to learn something new, if you want to be good at it, it's going to take 10,000 hours to get there. And I read this in book after book and website after website and my mental experience of reading all of this stuff. I was like, no. I don't have time. I don't have 10,000 hours. I am never going to be able to learn anything new ever again. But that's not true. So 10,000 hours just to give you a rough order of magnitude. 10,000 hours is a full time job for five years. That's a long time. And we've all had the experience of learning something new and it didn't take us anywhere close to that amount of time, right? So what's up? There's something kind of funky going on here. What the research says and what we expect and have experiences, they don't match up. And what I found, here's the wrinkle. The 10,000 hour rule came out of studies of expert level performance. There was a professor at Florida State University. His name is Kay Anders Erickson. He's the originator of the 10,000 hour rule. And where that came from is he studied professional athletes, world class musicians, chess grandmasters, all of these ultra competitive folks in ultra high performing fields. And he tried to figure out how long does it take to get to the top of those kinds of fields. And what he found is the more deliberate practice, the more time that those individuals spent practicing the elements, whatever it is that they do, the more time you spend, the better you get. And the folks at the tipi top of their fields put in around 10,000 hours of practice. Now, we're talking about the game of telephone a little bit earlier. Here's what happened. And author by the name of Malcolm Gladwell wrote a book in 2007 called Outliers, the story of success. And the centerpiece of that book was the 10,000 hour rule. Practice a lot, practice well, and you will do extremely well. You reach the top of your field. So the message, what Dr. Anderson was actually saying is, it takes 10,000 hours to get the top of an ultra competitive field in a very narrow subject. That's what that means. But here's what happened. Ever since Outliers came out, immediately came out, reached the top of the best cellular list, stayed there for three solid months. All of a sudden, the 10,000 hour rule was everywhere. And a society-wide game of telephone started to be played. So this message, it takes 10,000 hours to reach the top of an ultra competitive field, became, it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something. Which became, it takes 10,000 hours to become good at something. Which became, it takes 10,000 hours to learn something. But that last statement, it takes 10,000 hours to learn something. It's not true. It's not true. So what the research actually says, if I spent a lot of time here at the CSU Library in the cognitive psychology stacks, because I'm a geek. And when you actually look at the studies of skill acquisition, you see over and over and over a graph like this. Now researchers, whether they're studying a motor skill, something you do physically or a mental skill, they like to study things that they can time. Because you can quantify that, right? So they'll give research participants a little task, something that requires physical arrangement or something that requires learning a little mental trick. And they'll time how long a participant takes to complete the skill. And here's what this graph says. When you start, so when researchers gave participants a task, it took them a really long time, because it was new and they were horrible. With a little bit of practice, they get better and better and better. And the early part of practice is really, really efficient. People get good at things with just a little bit of practice. Now what's interesting to note is that if we don't really, for skills that we want to learn for ourselves, we don't care so much about time. Right? We just care about how good we are, whatever good happens to meet. So if we relable performance time to how good you are, the graph flips. And you get this famous and widely known, this is the learning curve. And the story of the learning curve is when you start, you're grossly incompetent and you know it. Right? With a little bit of practice, you get really good, really quick. So that early level of improvement is really fast. And then at a certain point, you reach a plateau and the subsequent gains become much harder to get. They take more time to get. Now, my question is, I want that. Right? How long does it take from starting something and being grossly incompetent and knowing it to being reasonably good? And hopefully, a short period of time, as possible. So how long does that take? Here's what my research says. 20 hours. That's it. You can go from knowing nothing about any skill that you can think of. Want to learn a language? Want to learn how to draw? Want to learn how to juggle flaming chainsaws? If you put 20 hours of focused, deliberate practice into that thing, you will be astounded. Astounded. That how good you are. 20 hours is doable. That's about 45 minutes a day for about a month. Even skipping a couple days here and there. 20 hours isn't that hard to accumulate. Now, there's a method to doing this. Because it's not like you can just start filling around for about 20 hours and expect these massive improvements. There's a way to practice intelligently. There's a way to practice efficiently that will make sure that you invest those 20 hours in the most effective way that you possibly can. And here's the method. It applies to anything. The first is to deconstruct the skill. Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done. And then look into the skill and break it down into smaller and smaller pieces. Most of the things that we think of as skills are actually big bundles of skills that require all sorts of different things. The more you can break apart the skill, the more you're able to decide. What are the parts of this skill that will actually help me get to what I want? And then you can practice those first. And if you practice the most important things first, you'll be able to improve your performance in the least amount of time possible. The second is learn enough to self correct. So get three to five resources about what it is you're trying to learn. Could be books, could be DVDs, could be courses, could be anything. But don't use those as a way to procrastinate on practice. I know I do this, right? Get like 20 books about the topics. Like I'm going to start learning how to program a computer when I complete these 20 books. No, that's procrastination. What you want to do is learn just enough that you can actually practice and self correct or self edit as you practice. So the learning becomes a way of getting better at noticing when you're making a mistake and then doing something a little different. The third is to remove barriers to practice. Distractions, television, internet, all of these things that get in the way of you actually sitting down and doing the work. And the more you're able to use just a little bit of willpower to remove the distractions that are keeping you from practicing, the more likely you are to actually sit down and practice, right? And the fourth is to practice for at least 20 hours. Now, most skills have what I call a frustration barrier. You know, the grossly incompetent knowing it part. That's really, really frustrating. We don't like to feel stupid. And feeling stupid is a barrier to us actually sitting down and doing the work. So by pre-committing to practicing whatever it is that you want to do for at least 20 hours, you will be able to overcome that initial frustration barrier and stick with the practice long enough to actually reap the rewards. All right, that's it. It's not rocket science. For very simple steps that you can use to learn anything. Now, this is easy to talk about in theory, but it's more fun to talk about in practice. So one of the things that I've wanted to learn how to do for a long time is play the ukulele. As anybody seeing Jake Shimabukuro's TED Talk where he plays the ukulele and makes it sound like he's like an ukulele god. It's amazing. It's like I saw this. That is so cool. It's such a neat instrument. I would really like to learn how to play. And so I decided that to test the theory I wanted to put 20 hours into practicing the ukulele and see where we got. And so the first thing about playing the ukulele is in order to practice, you have to have one. So I got an ukulele and my lovely assistant. Thank you, sir. I think I need the cord here. It's not just an ukulele. It's an electric ukulele. Yeah. So the first couple hours are just like the first couple hours of anything. You have to get the tools that you're using to practice. You have to make sure that they're available. My ukulele didn't come with strings attached. I had to figure out how to put those on. That's kind of important, right? And learning how to tune and learning how to make sure that all of the things that need to be done in order to start practicing, get done. Right? Now, one of the things when I was ready to actually start practicing was I looked in online to the bases and songbooks for how to play songs. And they say, OK, ukuleles, you can play more than one string at a time. So you can play chords. That's cool. You're accompanying yourself. Yeah, you. And when I started looking at songs, I had an ukulele cord book that had like hundreds of chords looking at the same. I was that's intimidating. But when you look at the actual songs, you see the same chords over and over, right? As it turns out, playing ukuleles is kind of like doing anything. There's a very small set of things that are really important and techniques that you'll use all the time. And so in most songs, you'll use four, maybe five chords. And that's it. That's the song. You don't have to know the hundreds as long as you know the four or the five. So while I was doing my research, I found a wonderful little medley of pop songs by a band called Accessive Awesome. And somebody knows it. And what Accessive Awesome says is that you can learn or you can play pretty much any pop song of the past five decades if you know four chords. And those chords are G, D, D minor, C. Four chords pump out every pop song ever, right? So I thought this is cool. I would like to play every pop song ever. So that was the first song I decided to learn. And I would like to actually share it with you. Ready? All right. Just a small town girl living in a lonely world. She took a midnight train going anywhere. I heard that you settled down. I found a girl that you're married now. Every night in my dreams, I see you. I feel you. That's just how I know it will go on. I won't hesitate no more, no more. It's cannot wait time yours. Because you are amazing. We did amazing things if I could. And I would go wherever you will. And try to feel the love tonight. And live with or without you. When I find myself, find myself in times of trouble. Mother Mary comes to me. Like I don't have a partner. No woman, no crap. I'm on the shoulder. Is a dream I come from a London under. Once a jolly swag man came to buy a bill of bond. Hey, I just met you. And this is crazy. Now here's my number. So call me. Hey, sexy lady. Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop. I'm Davenham style. I want to say goodbye. Closing time. Every new beginning comes from some other beginning. And... Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Thank you. Thank you. I love that song. And I have a secret to share with you. So by playing that song for you, I just hit my 20th hour of practicing the ukulele. Thank you. And so it's amazing, pretty much anything that you can think of. What do you want to do? The major barrier to learning something new is not intellectual. It's not the process of you learning a bunch of little tips or tricks or things. The major barrier is emotional. We're scared. Feeling stupid doesn't feel good. And the beginning of learning anything new, you feel really stupid. So the major barrier is not intellectual. It's emotional. It's scary. You put 20 hours into anything. Doesn't matter. What do you want to learn? Do you want to learn how to cook? You want to learn how to draw? What turns you on? What lights you up? Go out and do that thing. It only takes 20 hours. Have fun. Great job.",education,hi everyone two year ago life change forever wife kelsey welcome daughter lila world become parent amazing amazing experience whole world change overnight priority change

" You're evening. Good evening. How are you? Are you good? Great. Welcome, welcome, welcome to this match. This match will take exactly 18 minutes. Okay. And you're all part of the same team. Mechelin. Okay. Hey guys, I would like to see fair play on the field, respect and positivity. Is that okay for everyone? Cool. Good luck. One year ago, I decided I wanted to become a football referee, not because of the money though. I only get paid 20 euros per match. So I won't really get rich by it, will I? No, I decided to become a referee for two other reasons. One, to stay in good shape. Two, because I wanted to learn how not to take things personally. I can see some people nodding. You're probably thinking being a referee is the perfect environment to learn how not to take things personally, isn't it? Because the spectators hardly ever shout encouraging or positive things. No. What do they shout? Come on. Are you blind? Yeah. Yeah. Good. As a referee, I'm the scapegoat. Apparently I'm always wrong. It's always my fault. And I wanted to learn how not to take all this personally. Because I really struggle with this. For example, when I drive slowly, because I'm trying to find a specific location, and somebody is just driving behind me, I feel hunted, especially when they start honking and flashing their headlights. I take it personally. I know I shouldn't, but it just happens. Do you see what I mean? Yeah. Or when somebody can't just an appointment last minute, I get the feeling that I'm not important enough. Again, I take it personally. Even professionally. I'm a public speaker. Like tonight. This is what I do. I give keynote speeches, and I really like it as long as I can draw my audience into my story. Because the very moment I see somebody is not paying attention. For example, when somebody is looking at his smartphone, it just happens. I take it personally. I feel relaxed. You are safe tonight. Don't worry. Feel free to take your smartphones, and you can even start talking to your neighbor. I will not take it personally. Why not? Because now, here and now, I'm very conscious that this can happen. And more importantly, I have a strategy to deal with it. So tonight, I would like to share this strategy with you. Are you interested? Cool. Because I guess I'm not the only person in this room who sometimes takes things personally, right? Imagine you invite a friend to go to the movies, and she replies, oh, sorry, I have to work. But you see a picture on social media of her having dinner with some friends. That's very night. Or imagine you really have worked very hard on a project. You're really proud of the end result. But the only thing you get is criticism. So you come home, and you would like to wind down and share this terrible experience. But while you're telling your story, the other one walks away to switch on the TV. Now, who would take one of these situations personally? Show me hands. Come on. Lots of you. Why? Why do we take things personally? Somebody says or does something and bam, we feel hurts, neglected or offended, betrayed by the other one. That's what we believe, though. It's the other person's fault. He's responsible for what we feel. He's the one to blame. Now hang on, hang on. Who says that? Which part of us is speaking? It's our ego. Our ego thinks that others should take us into consideration. Our ego doesn't want to be criticized. Hell, no. Our ego wants to be acknowledged. I'm right. Is this what you want? Do you want to be right? That's exhausting. When my ego takes over, I'm fighting all day. I'm in a constant struggle with the rest of the world. And it drains my energy. Wouldn't it be so much easier to not take things personally? Because then no one has power over you. You are free. You experience much more harmony and connection between you and other people. Of course, because your energy can go towards nice things instead of endlessly battling against the things that drive you crazy. So the question is, do you want to be right? Or do you want to be happy? I know what some of you are thinking. I will make sure I will be happy by being right. Well, how do you do it? How to become happy by not taking things personally? You are standing at the kickoff of the match of your life, the match by which you will learn. How to stop taking things personally? So as a referee, I brought my coin for the task. And every coin has two sides. Heads or tails. And they stand for two strategies. Two strategies to no longer taking things personally. Sir, good evening. You are the captain of this huge team. You can choose. Heads or tails? Okay. You are lucky. It has. Are you ready for the first strategy? Okay. Here comes the first strategy. It is not about me. What do you mean? It is not about me. This sounds weird, doesn't it? Because when I take things personally, I am convinced it is about me. When I see someone is looking at his phone, I feel offended. I think, hey, I have put so much effort and time in this presentation. I want respect. I think me, myself and I. Sounds familiar, no? Yeah. But in fact, it isn't about me. What if I try to look at it from the other person's perspective, asking myself, why? Why is he or she looking at his or her smartphone? Maybe he has just received an important message when he has been waiting for. Or the topic of my presentation is not really his cup of tea. Or under country, he finds it very interesting. And he wants to take notes on his smartphone. Very smart to do that, by the way. I simply need to shift my focus from me to we. And I won't take it personally. If I try to see the intention of the other one, I make space for understanding instead of irritation. Does this ring a bell with you? When you put your son to bed, but he doesn't want you, he throws himself on the floor, kicking and screaming, I hate you. Do you take that personally? No, no, you don't because you know this is not about me. It's about what he wants, what he needs. He's angry because he just wants to say up a bit longer. That's all. So the first strategy to not take it personally is it's not about me. Look at the other person's intention. When a driver is still gating and flashing his lights, he probably does it because he's in a hurry. It's not about me. You see? It's as simple as that. In theory, because in real life, it turns out to be a hell of a job. Do you have any idea ladies and gentlemen, how many thoughts our brain produces a day? 50,000. And guess how many of them are positive? Only 10,000. So this means that 80% of what we think or negative thoughts, that's a lot, isn't it? When you see two colleagues talking to each other and just then they look at you and they start laughing, do you think, oh, they must have noticed my new shoes and they want them to. Now, what do you think? Don't they're laughing at me, they're gossiping about me. So it takes a lot of effort to correct yourself and say, hang on, I have no clue. They might be laughing about something that has nothing to do with me. So seeing the positive intention of the other one requires a lot of discipline and training. And that's why I became a referee. To train my brain, not to take things personally. I train my brain and now run half a week, the entire period of a match. I said it's for the football dummies. And now before the match, I'm warming up, not only physically, but also mentally. I give myself some pep talk into dressing room. Frederick watch out, lots of things will trigger you during the game. You're going to make decisions who some will not agree with. And they will shout unpleasant things at you. So I tell myself, Frederick, don't take it personally, it's not about me. They just want to be right. They simply want their team to win. You see, when I focus on the intention of the other person, there is no need to take it personally. When I apply this strategy very consciously, I admit it, I feel much more at ease on the field. When the coach, the players or the spectators do not agree with my decisions, I'm less easily thrown off balance. This strategy, ladies and gentlemen, works. Not always, unfortunately, because some words they shouted me like here, do really hit a raw nerve. You're a loser. Choose another hobby. You know what? Go fishing. Ouch. Maybe they are right. Perhaps I took the wrong decision. Maybe I am a loser. Honestly, it's how I feel sometimes. Do you see this? Every coin has a flip side. When this first strategy, it's not about me, doesn't work. It simply means it is about me. I have to look in the mirror and question myself. As a beginning referee, I still feel insecure, especially me. I never played soccer. It is about me because it has something to do with my insecurity. I doubt about myself. Or a part of myself that I haven't come to terms with. Do you see my point, ladies and gentlemen? Even if I know that a driver is only tailgating because he's in a hurry, I still take it personally when he hangs or is flushing his headlights. I must question myself. Probably I was driving too slowly. I'm aware of it. I just don't like that clumsy part of myself. Why else would I take it personally? When I say, ladies and gentlemen, you are an orange. Who would take this personally? No one, right? Why not? Because nothing in you believes that you are in fact an orange. Unless, of course, that you are ginger and you feel bad because of that. Which is luckily not the case with me. But when someone says, Frederick, you are so selfish. Ouch, I do take it personally. And it only happens because I know there is some truth in it. From honest, I'm aware of the fact that I do not always take into account other people's needs. When you are being criticized and it hurts, chances are big that this is rooted in your childhood. Maybe as a child, you were never good enough. When you came home with a nine out of ten, they said, hey, and a nine out of ten. You see, you can only take things personally if it somehow touches a raw nerve. And that's the moment to give yourself some empathy. This hurts, darn. I'm longing so hard for recognition. And I feel sad if I don't get it. You see? And you can also, why not? Speak up. Just tell the other one what's going on inside you. Hey, I'm in the middle of my story here and you just walk away to switch on the TV. It feels as if you don't care about my story. It's not nice. By opening up, by being vulnerable, by telling what you feel without blaming the other one, you increase the chance that the other one will understand you and take your needs into account. You see what I mean? To conclude, how not to take things personally? One, it is not about me. Look at the other person's intention. If that doesn't work, two, it is about me. Give yourself empathy and speak up. Ladies and gentlemen, please, pretty please, do not take it personally, but I really do hope that you will take a couple of things personally within the next hours and days. Only if you do, you can test out these two strategies. Imagine, just imagine, we could all, if we could all put this in practice, wouldn't that enhance our relationships enormously together, we could create a better world. Wouldn't that be great? And as a referee, I even earn some money by it. Who does it like 20 euros to learn how not to take things personally? Show me hands. Show me hands. Oh, so many. Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros now? Who still wants the 20 euros? People may attack you, criticize you, or ignore you. They can crumple you up with their words, spit you out, or even walk over you. Remember, whatever they do or say, you will always keep your value. Thank you.",psicology,you re evening good evening good great welcome welcome welcome match match take exactly minute okay you re part team mechelin okay hey guy would like see fair play field respect

keep value thank
" Thank you. Thank you. Why is it that intelligent people procrastinate? Why is it that people that are so self-motivated, often self-savotage? Why is it that no matter how many new business opportunities we get, or new skills we try to learn, many of us are simply finding different ways of earning the same amount of money or achieving the same kind of level of success as if there was a glass ceiling above our head that we were trying to break through but didn't know how. One thing we do know is that it's not down to lack of resources or opportunity. We live in a time in history where there are more resources and opportunity than ever before. In fact, there's many people that have access to resources and opportunity that really never get the battle of the shoulder and take a swing at life and the results in mediocre or disappointing. And then there's other people. Those who have access to virtually no resources or no opportunity and against all of the odds went out and created magic for the rest of us to go, wow, and stand in awe of. People like Colonel Sanders, who retired broke at 65 before starting KFC. Obviously Oprah, people like Helen Keller. We're even Albert Einstein, who dropped out of school at 15 and then failed the entrance exam for the Zurich Polytechnic. Now, you see, if you want to master class in taking away the excuse that resources and opportunity are the reason why you're not successful, go study any of the lives of the people on screen. We see as human beings, a nervous system is hard-wired for comfort. Whereas the essence of what makes us us, some would say our soul, is hard-wired for growth. And it's managing that dynamic tension between how good a comfort zone feels and the innate calling of our potential that lies outside of that that causes the frustration for most people and keeps them on the hamster wheel of mediocrity. So how do we unravel that? Well, let's look at the human brain. See, what separates us from almost all of the animal kingdom, the crowning achievement of human biology is the front part of the brain, what's known as the neocortex of the frontal lobe. And that neocortex operates at a brave wave, a brain wavelength of alpha-orbita. And one of the challenges is that that doesn't get turned on until we're about seven years old. See, kids operate in Delta and Theta, which is why babies sleep so much, and my kids live in that magical fantasy world where they're operating at Theta with no critical thinking. Now, it also means children are very impressionable, and why Aristotle is widely quoted as saying that, give me the child for seven years, and I'll give you the men. But what happens when we drill down on that? Why is that important to why we procrastinate or self-savotage? Well, I'll give you an example. Let's say it's Dad's turn to take Little Johnny shopping and the kids. And, you know, Mom's busy that day and he's kind of frustrated, he's got to go out and get the job done. And one thing you need to know about Dad, he's got his own stuff to deal with right now. He's figuring out how to pay the credit card bill that was higher this month than he thought. He's worried about whether the boss is going to be downsizing soon, and he's still reeling from the lack of intimacy that morning caused by a fight that he had with his wife. He's dealing with the stuff as we all do. Now, Little Johnny doesn't live in that world. And so when they get to the checkout, as every good retail psychologist knows, they place the products at the eye height of the people you're trying to sell to. And so Johnny sees the toys and Johnny wants the toys. He's like, Daddy, Daddy, can I have a toy? And Daddy comes out of his mind fog and says, no, you can't have a toy. For starters, I'm thinking of Ford it, but now it's just not the time. But as parents will understand, children are prime examples of the ability to be persistent or they not. And so Little Johnny says, Daddy, Daddy, I want a toy. Please can I have a toy? See, Little Johnny doesn't live in a world of credit card debt. And then his frustration on dealing with his stuff and trying to handle the kids and all the other stuff, Daddy snaps out and says, listen, you can't have a toy. You don't deserve it. You're not good enough. You're not behaved enough today. And Daddy thinks that'll just keep him quiet while he goes back to dealing with his big world problems. But what's happening right now is quite significant. You see, Little Johnny doesn't hear that's frustration. All Johnny hears is that I'm not good enough. I'm not worth it and I'm undeserving. And probably spends a large part of the rest of his life unconsciously acting out that behavior to justify why he's right, including self-savotaging if the threat of success comes along to challenge that in a model of the world. Hmm. You see, when it comes to being able to work with psychology and after thousands of hours of working with people all over the world, I've come to know that the undisputed first law in psychotherapy, again, intervention and other areas. Now, the undisputed first law of personal growth is this, that people will never rise above the opinion of themselves. Now, one of the challenges that opinion is largely formed in our childhood years, sub-7, from the perception of where we think we did or didn't get love from the people we most wanted it from. Hmm. I usually let people sit with that one for a while. It also mirrors the first law of relationships, which I firmly believe states that no one can ever love us more than we love ourselves. Now, one of the other challenges on that is that we're also creatures of habit. Now, what does that mean? That means that that prefrontal cortex, that neo-cortex, that frontal lobe that serves all of that executive decision making, is prime real estate. In fact, the brain weighs 150th of the body weight, but takes up 20% of all of the calories. So, when it comes to using that frontal lobe, evolution has some shortcuts. It says, well, clearly, you're using intelligence to make the decision. So, it should be a good decision. So, when you choose the fries instead of the salad, it doesn't care. It's job is to adapt. And if you make that decision over and over again, then rather than take up critical thinking, which is meant to serve you intelligently, it hands it over to the mid-brain. And it becomes an unconscious behavior or pattern, or what we also call a habit. So, now you order the fries just because it's what you do. You don't even question it. Now, that can be very useful when it comes to learning, or not learning how to have to walk every day. But, it also sets up some challenges. You see, we suddenly arrive at work on that day off, we don't know why. Or, you know, we suddenly get home and realize, where did the last two kilometers or two miles of driving go? Wow, how did I avoid all of the crazies? Good old mid-brain at work. But the deeper challenge to that as creatures of habit is the fact that we're using our conscious brain only a small amount of the time, that critical decision making, the rest of the time, like 95% of the time, is what I call people sleeping awake, if I'll give you an analogy. What you imagine that the conscious mind isn't ant. Here he is, cute little fella. Ants are industrious, they're hardworking, they're determined, they're going to get the job done. This is your conscious mind. In fact, this particular ant went to a person development seminar last week. He set his goals, and he's marching north, confidently in the direction of his achievements. The problem is, he's marching over the back of an elephant that's heading south, our unconscious mind, with all of our limiting patterns, limiting beliefs, on all of the other unresolved self-issues that go on there. And we start to see why we self-savotage. See, how do you get that elephant moving in the right direction? Let me give you another example, another analogy. The mind is like a compass needle. In fact, it can only point in one direction at a time. But when we're operating from our ants, that 5% of the time where we're conscious and using free will, we can grab that compass needle and we can point it anywhere. That's what free will allows us to do. If we're feeling down, we can go choose to watch a comedy or call a friend who can cheer us up. If we're feeling low on energy, we can go put the kettle on and make ourselves a coffee or a drink. But 95% of the time, we're not doing that. And as soon as we let our hand off of that compass needle consciously, it will always drift back to its default magnetic north, which unfortunately for most people is more negative than positive. I've seen. And that leads us to our third challenge. And that is something you may want to really tattoo on the inside of your eyelids. And that is that environment trumps will. What do I mean by that? I mean that our intention will always be beaten by our environment over time. For example, let's say that you're a music fan, but you don't like jazz. You ask for the other people. You're kind of a country in Western kind of guy or girl. And you listen to country in Western in the car going to work, but your car's broken down this week, so you're good neighbor around the corner that works at the same place as offered to give you a lift. So you're going to share the 45 minute drive to work and back for the next five days. But they listen to jazz. Now, I don't care what you think consciously within three days. I know what's going to happen within three days in the car. You're tapping your feet to the beat. Within five days, you're humming it in the shower. You see, we don't get to choose whether or not we get programmed. We're programmable by design. We can only choose how we want to be programmed. Another way saying that is you can have all of the intention to be as warm and hot as you like. You can raise your body temperature. You can put on some big clothes. But if you choose to live in a freezer, the environment's going to win over time. In other words, you can read all of the positive affirmations. You can stand in front of the mirror and say that you believe in yourself. But if you live with somebody who is constantly pulling you down, somebody who is reminding you of why you're not good enough and why it won't work, at some point you're going to start to believe it. That's the law of conformity. If you hang out with nine recreational drug users, I've got news for you. You're most likely going to become the tenth. If you hang out with nine positive people that look at life through the lens of how we can, not why we can't, to hold up a mirror for each other's greatness, to be midwives to each other's dreams instead of stealing them, you're likely going to become the tenth or you'll leave the environment. It's the 95 percent law of the law of conformity. So how do we change that? Well, there's three tips that I want to share with you that'll help turn this around. I'm pretty simple guys, so I want to give you some pretty simple tips and I'm breaking into three things. The first is, stop putting the wrong things in. You see, as I said, we are adaptation machines. Our bodies, our physical bodies adapt to our environment. We don't get to choose that. We only get to choose the environment we put them in. If it's the gym or McDonald's, the body doesn't care. It's job is to adapt, but it's the same with our mind. So stop putting the wrong programming in. In other words, if you think of the two biggest things that impact us unconsciously more than anything else, it's the mainstream media and our peer group of who we hang with. Let's touch on the media for a second. Now, for those of you that still think that the mainstream media is about reporting the news, I've got news for you. You're in Disneyland. See, the job of the media is not to report the news. You're kidding me? The job of the mainstream media is to stimulate another part of the brain called the amygdala, which is designed evolutionarily to notice negative before positive, so that they can hook your attention out of the mass of the crowd and record you as a viewing statistic to justify rate cards and advertising. The media is not a charity. So I haven't watched a news report or read a newspaper for pretty much 17 years now. For those of you that still watch things like, is it CNN, constant negative news? I've got news for you. From what I understand, it's all the same news. It's the same news it was 17 years ago. It's just happening to different people. You cannot watch the news and be positive. It's like saying, I want to be healthy and I smoke. It doesn't work. You can go to the gym as many times as you want, but if you're smoking, you can't be healthy. It's a binary equation. If you're being programmed by the mainstream media, you can't have that default magnetic north move away from being negative. It's constant programming. People say, how do you know what's going on in the world? Are you kidding me? Everything's going on in the world. A far better question would be, what do you want to choose to focus on? Think of the Amazon rainforest at night. Everything's going on. But the media want to take you a little flashlight in your hand and point it. It's like, oh my goodness, look at this. It's a snake eating a rat. Versus you saying, yeah, but have a look at this hummingbird being born. It's just a choice. I have no clue what's going on in the world. I have every clue what's going on in my world. If something's important enough, it'll find me. Stop programming yourself with why the world won't work and start taking charge of where you point your flashlight. The other thing is about peer group. Some people say, yeah, I could probably change my friends and some of us maybe should. But I can't change my family. My brother is the most negative person I know. My mother-in-law is always telling me I'm not good enough for her son or whatever it may be. Well, I know that we can't change our family. And looking at the reasons why you chose your parents is another TED talk. But the best advice I can give is love your family. Choose your friends. Now the second thing, start putting the right things in. Now we live in a time and society where there's so much great information, whether it's a podcast, whether it's inspirational interviews, whether it's books or the lives of some of the people we looked at earlier. Every single day or at least every single week, if you want to take your compass needle and start remagnetizing it in a positive direction by exposing yourself to the kind of information that supports your potential and your greatness and where you want to go. Yeah, there's no excuse for not being able to do that now in a society where it's so available. But if you're not choosing to do that, by default, you're going to be hooked into somebody else's agenda. If you don't start filming as the star of the movie in your life, by default, you're going to end up as a film extra in somebody else's. And then the third point, get the things that shouldn't be in there out. What do I mean by that? You know, work with a decent mentor or a coach that understands how to do that. A coach that understands how to navigate the minefield of human behavior. Somebody that isn't just going to teach you skills, but somebody that can reach in and find those unconscious patterns and be able to rip them out for good. I'll give you an example. I had a client come to me a while back who said, oh, I want to learn time management. Now, a normal coach or what have you would probably teach them some good time management skills. But within two minutes, it was easy to see that time management wasn't the issue. The real issue was his inability to deal with rejection. And therefore, he was saying, he wasn't saying no to people because by saying no, it would trigger a rejection response. And therefore, he was saying yes to too many things and therefore there was too much on his calendar and therefore he thought he needed time management. You get the idea. You see, when we're able to start addressing things like unconscious programming, when we start to create the best habits that we can by programming ourselves consciously, when we start grabbing that compass needle and bringing it over to the right direction so that the 95% of the time was sleeping awake, we're able to be who we need to be. That's when we can start to achieve the real game in town, which is self mastery. See, before you spend another penny on workshops or skills or anything, work on yourself. See, mastering the game of self throughout human history has been the number one recommendation of virtually everybody that achieved it and then preach the benefits of it to people that usually weren't listening. But by mastering our sense of self, we're able to walk into a room where everything's descending into chaos and retain our center. When everything's breaking down around us with the eye of the storm, it's like move, I'll handle it. See, that's the best way that you'll be able to handle uncertainty. And when we commit to self mastery, we give ourselves the best shot of becoming the best and greatest versions of our self that we can be. And then we get to become the example and the invitation to others. Not the imposition, nobody changes because you tell them to. People change because they're inspired to change and we can only inspire them by being the example and the invitation. And at that point, we have a chance of being able to really make a change in this world, make a difference, which is what the world needs right now. And ultimately, be the embodiment of what Gandhi said, which was to be the change you wish to see in the world. Thank you and God bless.

" It's really good to be here and I want to first acknowledge these students because this is not easy when you're a student, it's not even easy when you're a professional. So can we get these guys a hand? Thank you. I'm here to talk to you about two things that you would think just do not go together. Those two things are emotional intelligence and the laws of attraction. I was talking to Dr. Thomas the other day when I came for the rehearsal and he said, well, doc, emotional intelligence isn't that being aware and having clarity about your feelings and the feelings of other people when you're in the midst of a set of circumstances or a situation with them. And I say, yeah, that is definitely a definition for that and a very accurate definition for that. But the truth about emotional intelligence goes far beyond having just clarity about people. It's clarity about situations, circumstances. Why are you there? When you stop and think about, I'm in this situation. I'm in the midst of something. Now what is that something? And more than likely that something is a set of circumstances or a dilemma you may have encountered that you attracted into your life. And that's where the laws of attraction come to meet emotional intelligence. Like attracts like these things that you expect come to you. What we believe is that if we say some affirmations, if we take a moment and visualize something and do a vision board or something of that nature, that's what's going to happen. But not true. As a matter of fact, if I say right now, do not think of a chimpanzee wearing a red tie and a blue and white pinstripe suit, whatever you do, do not picture this chimpanzee wearing this red bow tie and this blue pinstripe suit. What do you keep thinking of? The very thing that I tell you don't think about because that is where you are putting your emotion, that energy plus motion and the more emotion you pour into anything, the more of that thing you receive. In other words, you can say one thing and do another. And as we well know many of us, typically say all the right things, but do we do them? If you don't believe me, go to somebody's house and look at all the dusty work out equipment. Look at all the diets that they tried. Go to a gym and look at the people that signed up that are no longer coming because what we have done is we've taken the laws of attraction and misapplied them. We don't take serious the things that we feel we deserve enough in order for them to manifest into our lives. And how do you stop that? No simple. Monitor what you feel. What you constantly think about, that is exactly what you get. If you keep thinking, my luck is never, everybody gets it with me. I'll never have that. I'll never live in that house. You know, that's for them. Whoever them or those people are. Can you constantly think about how much bills are? What do you end up with? More pink slips, more bills. When you constantly think about, I don't want to gain any more weight. Or I don't, I need to lose, you know, lose some of these bad habits that I have. I want to stop smoking. I'm not going to smoke. What do you do the minute to pressure hits? You go get a cigarette and you smoke again. You get frustrated and you eat again. And as you continue to do these things, your thoughts and your feelings equal the manifestations that you get in your life. Here's the million dollar solution to that. First monitor what you think about. Your mind, and you know, there's a lot of theories around this concept, but I'm going to tell you this, everything that is seen comes from that which was not seen. That chair you're sitting in, the clothes you have on right now, was somebody I did one time. Somebody figured, I don't know a long time ago, guys should wear a tie. You know, we figured somehow that, you know, going on horses wasn't enough. Maybe if I can build this contraption, I could fly like a bird. Everything that we do started out in the unseen and someone called those things that are not as though they are and brought them into manifestation. But here's the catch for you and the solution. You must understand that conscious thinking is not your solution. Conscious thinking is typically reacting to some set of circumstances. It's typically paying attention to that which is before you. That subconscious thinking, you will associate that with stuff like, have you ever driven home from work and you don't even remember driving home because something was just on your mind or you automatically get in the car and you just check for something without even paying attention to what you're doing. Your subconscious mind is the part of you that drives the outcomes in your life as you learn to master being sensitive to circumstances, paying particular attention to the nonsical things as we call it the little things. If you stop worrying about what happened in the past and feeling guilty or being anxious about what may or may not happen in the future and operate in right now, you will train your subconscious mind to begin manifesting the things that you truly desire. And a short way of putting this is everything in your life happens for a reason. Your responsibility is to look at these things in your life and ask this question, why now? Why is this person getting on my last nerve? Well, they're probably getting on your nerves because there's some part of your character that is being reflected back to you through them that you need to work on. We get frustrated and angered and almost just discombobulated by that which we do not understand. You have to be willing to take the time in every moment, every situation in your life and examine it for its meaning. You have to examine it for its purpose. You have to examine it to see what is this supposed to teach me right now in my practice, something that I constantly tell people that I'm either speaking to in lectures like this or even in my office, is to stop being so reactive and become proactive. Don't wait to talk. Truly listen. Don't just see things. Look at them. You know, when you hear something, you're perceiving it at the expense of all the white noise or the debris that surrounds it. When you look at something, you are deliberately ignoring things that otherwise could distract you. It takes effort to be successful, but the greatest effort is mastering how do you use your mind as we evolve? And I'm not getting into some religious stuff so there will be no offering. You don't have to panic. But we came from somewhere. We received a greater source and conceived when our parents decided to confirm that. The My Belief is before we get here, we made a decision while we were coming and we came to experience the contrast and the challenge that everyday life presents to us. See, your Creator, which you are a co-participant in that creation, is smarter than you think. As a matter of fact, you can figure out exactly what everything means in your life by asking one question, one word, why? And it's okay. You know, even in dating, ladies, it's good to look at a guy and say, well, why are you here? What is it that you are supposed to teach me? And not thinking, he will probably tell you the truth. The same thing is true about the things that you're trying to court in your day-to-day life, in your career. Ask yourself, why am I doing this? What is motivating me to do this? Why do I feel the way that I feel about what I'm doing? And you know you do not have to wait for an answer. You can get an answer if you shut everything down, get in a quiet space and simply meditate. And I don't mean low disposition going, what I do mean is taking the time to be quiet, to be still, to allow your circumstances to speak to you in such a way that it resonates at the core. You remember I said, emotion. It's kind of like that guy or counter when you're looking around for a male object. And the further away you get, the further away the chirps get, but the closer you get, the closer those chirps get. And the way that you can parallel that to your spirit speaking to you is the better you feel about it, the more you should do it. And if it doesn't make sense to anyone but you, all the better, accept the facts, but never ever confuse the facts with the truth. Seek the greater truth. You know, anything that anyone has ever done that has required more, cause that individual to confront themselves, they confront at their fears, they confront at other people, they confront at culture and had to make a decision that you know what you said I can't, the system says I can't, but something inside me says what I can. And when you seek the greater truth, you get into direct alignment for that very moment, that very reason, that purpose that causes your emotional intelligence and the laws of attraction to become one. As they become one, you will find this sense of passion resonating, causing and stirring up something inside of you. As that passion is stirred up, your purpose then just comes forth. You know, there's this thing, if you ever watch a football game, you don't see the guy sit there and wait on the ball to come and you don't see the quarterback throw it after the guy is down feel, right when he snaps the ball. That receiver takes off, that ball is in there. Sometimes you have to run on faith, you have to run, not seeing the outcome, but just knowing that there will be the result that you desire. And as you feel, as you believe, you will receive, because after all, that which you seek ladies in gentlemen, that which you desire, that which you long for is equally seeking you.

" In my past life as a soccer coach, once you win a national championship, everybody wants to come play for you, really not true. Once you pay them $25,000 a year in scholarships, everybody wants to come play for you. And parents would always come to me and they'd say, okay, my son and my daughter wants to come play at your university. What is it that we have to do? What are you looking for? And being the Socratic Professor that I am, well, what does your son or daughter do? What do they do really well that we'd be interested in? And typically their answers are, well, they've got great vision. They're really good. They can see the entire field. Or my daughter is the fastest player. There's nobody that can beat her. Or my son's got a great left footer, really, really great in the air and can head every ball. I like, yeah, not bad. But to be quite honest with you, those are the last things I'm looking for. The most important thing, self confidence. Without that skill, and I use the word skill intentionally, without that skill, we are useless as a soccer player. Because when you lose sight or belief in yourself, we're done for. I use the definition of self confidence to be the ability or the belief to believe in yourself to accomplish any task, no matter the odds, no matter the difficulty, no matter the adversity, the belief that you can accomplish it, self confidence. Some are using a great, I don't have it. I'm so shy, I'll never do good. And you start to drag all the way down here. But I use the word skill because I believe it can be trained. And I'll show you a couple of ways of which we do. Hopefully I won't run out of time. I don't use any slides because my speech always goes here, here, here. So we'll see which way we get to. The easiest way to build self confidence. There's no magic button. I can't say, this plane is going down. Who can fly it? Put your hand up. I can, I'm confident. Repetition, repetition, repetition. What does Malcolm Gladwell call it? The 10,000 hour rule? There's no magic button. I recruited a goalie from Columbia, South America one year. Big tall six foot three man. He had hands like stone. I thought he was like flipper. Three time I thaw him the ball. Thunk, on the ground. I was like, oh my god, we're in trouble. Simple solution. Get to the wall, kick a ball against the wall and catch it. Kick the ball against the wall and catch it. His goal was 350 a day for eight months. He came back. His hands were calloused. The moisture on his hands were literally gone. He is now playing in Europe. Magic, no. Repetition, repetition, repetition. The problem is we expect to be self-confident. But we can't be unless the skill or the task we're doing is not novel, is not new to us. We want to be in a situation where we've created, we've had so much pressure in that. And what I mean because pressure builds diamonds. We want to be in a situation where, hey, I've done this a thousand times. I did my speech in front of the mirror. I'm sounding good. And then I went in front of my kids and my wife. I was like, oh my gosh, I'm a little nervous. Then I get in front of the Glen Gould. Oh my goodness, I'm a little more nervous. By the time I get to the ACG, where 2,500 people can't say anymore, right? 2,500 people, where 2,500 people are there, I won't have a single ounce of nervousness because of my ability to practice, right? Over and over and over again. The problem with repetition is, how many of us bail after the first bit of failure? How many of us bail after the first bit of adversity? Edison was on that video. And depends who you ask. There's anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 tries to build that light bulb. 1,000 to 10,000. JK Rowling should be on that video. You know what I mean? Publishers, she took her Harry Potter book too. I believe the number was 12 or 13. I'm pretty confident. But after two or three knows, I'd be like, dang it. After six or seven, I'm like, maybe not. Definitely after nine or ten, I'd be looking to be a soccer coach or something else to be cited author. Right? I mean, 12 times, somebody said no. Not practice, practice, practice, and do not accept failure. Maybe it shouldn't be repetition. Maybe the answer should be persistence. Because we all repeat something, but very few of us really will persist. So that's one way to build self-confidence. Get out there. Do what you want to do and do not accept no. The other one is self-talk. We all have a self-talk tape that plays in our head. Anybody go shopping and put on a pair of pants this week? If you're a woman, the first thing that always comes, damn, I look fat in these pants. And if you're a man, it's the opposite. Oh, God, I have no muscle. I'm so flabby. We all have this tape that plays in our head. As a student, if they ask me the question, it was like, oh, she, please, please, professor, don't pick me. I don't know the answer. I look down. Right? If you're in the book, when I, let me tell you something, and the VP of Business Administrator is here, I shouldn't repeat this. But when they hired me as an athletic director, I sat in an architect's meeting and I am as dumb as a post when it comes to anything to do with numbers and angles. And they're like the fundable later valve of the architectural, what do you think, Dr. Joseph? Let me look into that for you and get back to you. Right? I was in a God, God, don't please, don't ask me, please don't ask me. We all have this negative self-talk that goes in our head. Guess what? There's enough people that are telling us we can't do it that we're not good enough. Why do we want to tell ourselves that? We know for a fact that thoughts influence actions. We saw it there with the video, Sheldon, Dr. Levy, so right? We know that our thoughts influence actions. Why do we want to say that negative self-talk to ourselves? We need to get our own self-affirmations. Muhammad Ali, what was his self-affirmation? I am the greatest. Who else is going to tell you? There's need to be quiet moments in your bedroom, quiet moments when you're brushing your teeth, that we need to reaffirm. I am the captain of my ship and the master of my fate. That is my affirmation. I came from a school of 1,000 people. I lived in a town of 1,000 people for 15 years. There's no reason that I should be in charge of the National Electric Department, building Maple Leaf Gardens. But I am the captain of my ship and the master of my fate. If I don't say it, if I don't believe it, no one else will. How do you build self-confidence? Get away from the people who will tear you down. There's enough of that. Muhammad Ali, I am the greatest. There is no one better than me. It's a difference between hubris and ego and false pride. It's just reminding yourself in quiet, silent moments. I put it down on the list. It's right beside my mirror. About all the things that make me who I am. Because I make enough mistakes and the newspapers will recognize it and people around me will recognize it and they'll tear me down. Pretty soon I'll begin to believe it. There was a time when my confidence was really low. There was a time when I took this job, when I came from Iowa, I don't know if I could do it. I had to bring out my self-confidence letter. A letter I wrote to myself when I was feeling good. Ivan, congratulations on getting your PhD before 40. I am 40, under. Congratulations on winning a national championship. Good job on raising three good kids and marrying the right woman. I wrote a letter to myself. It was my own bragg sheet, my own letter about the things I was proud of. Because there are moments and we'll all experience them in our career, in our life, in our job hunting, in our relationships, when we are not feeling good about who and what and where we are. I had to bring out that letter and read it time and time again. For a period of about two weeks to weather me through that storm, it was important. Stop the self-talk, the negative self-talk. If you'll watch, you'll see some athletes still have a little bandage or a little brand around them. Lance Armstrong is a perfect one. What's his self-affirmation? Liv Strong is in a brand. It was to remind him of who he was. Liv Strong. Then it came a brand. He would move that from one arm to the next arm when doubt and fear came into his mind. Liv Strong, put it on there. Let's go. We'll all have it. Replace it. Two ways to build self-confidence. Worried about my time, I'm going to tell you of one way that you can build self-confidence in others. We are coaches or educators. We are teachers. We are people who will create value in the world. And in doing that, we are critical by the nature of what we do. I am a coach. I want you to score a goal. Ball went over high. Dang it. The ball went high. Thank you, coach. I know that. Feedback tells me that. So what do we do? I need you to put your elbow or hair and put your knee over the ball and you need to follow through. Boom. Land. Good eight. Notice I never made it as a professional. What can we do? We fix mistakes. When I'm fixing that mistake, Johnny, this is terrible. You need to bend your knee and you need to do this. What have I done to Johnny self-confidence? Bend your knee. Think of this. Think of this. Next thing you know, Johnny's crushed. Ignore what Johnny does wrong and find Bob or Sally or Frida over here. Great goal, Frida. I loved how you kept your knee low. You followed through and you landed like this. Great job. Johnny. You? Great. Johnny's not demoralized. His confidence isn't shot and what I've done is I've built up Frida's. Imagine how we could change the way we parented kids. Instead of get that glass off the counter, what's wrong with you? If we catch the mother good, great job. Great job. Thank you, Alice, for taking your glass to the counter. It's some simple but we forget about it. Or as educators or as somebody as a team, if we manage to praise the positive behavior that we wanted to reinforce, we forget it. It sounds so simple. Catch them when they're good. We forget it. It's simple. Here's what they did. There was a study in Kansas that did this. They did video and we all do video and we showed the video of them doing the run of the play. This goal happened because the basket wasn't protected. We didn't rotate here right. We needed to do this and then cover the slot. And if that's the baseline, improvement of the Kansas state team went like this. And they said they ignored all of that and they just showed them the times they did it right. The times they did it perfect that presented no goals, spoke to the same points, improvement went like that. It changed and revolutionized the way we as coaches interact with our student athletes. We can apply that to the business world. We can apply that to our student group works. We can apply that to our management teams easily. Catch them when they're good. Last and certainly not least. My son is really good at this. Self-confident people interpret feedback the way they choose to. I asked my son who is by the far terrible, terrible athlete. Gets it from his dad. The game went five minutes. How's the game? Oh great. I scored three goal that got to assist. I'm like I did not see him touch the puck. But he has his own perception of how he did. I love it. Hey, I'm that guy. I'm like I remember when I met my wife and was in the comments. Paulie, I'd like to go to the movies. Ladies. Diggo, diggo, diggo. And she goes, she goes, no. I ask her again because I think that she just hasn't seen me in the right light. Maybe that's not the wrong shirt on, right? Because I'm interpreting that the way I want to interpret it. Finally, I ask her again. She gave me this one comment, right? She sent it to her friend because that's the way you did it back then. She wouldn't date you unless it was the last person on earth that hell was freezing over. There was a small chance we had to save the planet earth. Some people was like there's no chance. I'm like you're saying there's a chance. Right? Because that's how I'm going to interpret it. If I could give you one thing to take from this, it is no one will believe in you unless you do. Listen to the words of that video. Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes. We're supposed to be different folks. And when people look at us, believe in yourself.

" Have you ever been nervous or felt fear when you've had to speak in public? And maybe you've been on a stage in front of a room full of people or maybe you had a share of presentation in front of your coworkers or maybe you've been in a room full of strangers and they made you stand up and say who you are, where you're from and what you do. Now at some point most people have felt what it feels like to be afraid to speak in public. For me I grew up with a tremendous fear of public speaking and my earliest memory of having a fear to speak happened in the second grade. Our teacher was going around the room and calling on students to read. Anybody been there? I was thinking please don't call on me, please don't call on me, please don't call on me. She called someone else. I can relax. But as they would get to the end of what they were reading that anxiety would start to build again. Please don't call on me, please don't call on me and then it happened. She called my name and this wave of anxiety came over my body and as I started to read I started fumbling over my words and the more I tried to get it together the worse it got. I started hearing other kids laughing at me and by the time I finished I was so embarrassed. I remember thinking I never want to do that again and it created this memory early on. You're not a public speaker. This isn't for you. You just need to stay quiet and I kept that memory for years to come. Fast forward to my freshman year in college. I had to take a speech class. When I got up to give my speech that familiar wave of anxiety came over my body again. My heart started beating out of my chest. My adrenaline was racing. My throat got dry. My muscles started to tense up and when I was looking at my note card my hands just started shaking. When I tried to speak my voice started trembling and I felt this wave of heat come over my body and I felt like I was about to pass out and somehow I made it through the speech but that further anchored into my mind you're not a speaker. You just need to give this up and I continue to believe that for years. Public speaking is not for me but over the years I kept feeling this feeling inside that I have a message to share but I needed to speak that I can make a bigger impact. So that led me to the first key that helped me overcome my fear of public speaking was the realization that everyone has a message to share. Each and every one of you has a message inside of you that the world is waiting to hear. And your message matters but maybe you're like me for years I didn't think I had a message to share. I wondered what could I share that would help someone else? Well my friend and mentor Rory Vaden says it best he says you are perfectly positioned to serve the person you once were. Think about that there's stuff you've been through in your life there's lessons you've learned obstacles you've overcome and there's lessons you've learned along the way that you can take and help other people because right now there's someone going through what you went through in the past and you can take those lessons you've learned and help them overcome their challenges. So I started going through my life and I started thinking well what have I been through and what lessons have I learned that I could use to help others. And I started sharing those and it started helping people and that's why I'm here today sharing this message because I overcame the fear of public speaking years ago and I wanted to share what helped me so other people can share their message with the world. So first I realized I had a message to share then I started asking myself well what goes through my head that makes me so nervous before I get up to speak. And I would think thoughts like they're going to judge me what if they don't like the way I look or the way I'm dressed or what if they don't like the sound of my voice or what if I mess up and I say the wrong thing all those thoughts that were going through my head were about me me me me and I realized I needed to shift that and that led me to the second realization that helped me overcome my fear of public speaking was realizing that sharing your message is not about you it's about the people you're there to serve and what's in it for them and my friend Rory Vaden says it best he's he told me fear disappears when the mission to serve is clear when you have the heart to serve people you take the focus off of you and you start focusing on what's the benefit that they're going to get by hearing my message and that changed everything for me when I took the focus off of me and I started focusing on what are they going to get out of my message I realized if one person takes what I have to say and applies it to their life it was worth it so key number one is you have a message to share number two your message is not about you it's about the people you're there to serve now the next thing I started to do was I started to study well what is fear and fear is our body's natural response to danger when our body feels danger we go into the fight or flight response and we get ready to run or fight for our lives so I was studying well what are the common causes of fear and the most common physiological responses to fear are increased heart rate increase the adrenaline shallow breathing muscle tension sweating dry mouth and butterflies in the stomach well I used to get most of those when I would get up to speak but I started to ask myself what other times do I feel those feelings well I feel those feelings when I get excited so I looked up what are the most common causes or the the common physiological responses to excitement and they are increased heart rate increase the adrenaline shallow breathing muscle tension sweating dry mouth and butterflies in the stomach our bodies go through the exact same physiological response in response to fear or excitement so the way to tell the difference if it's fear is associated with a threat or danger or if it's excitement it's positive anticipation so it all comes down to am I in danger or am I looking forward to this and that led me to the third key that helped me overcome my fear was that I could transform my fear into excitement so when you get up and you start to share your message and you feel those familiar feelings what I used to do was say oh there's that fear again remember when you used to speak before that didn't go so well they're gonna judge you this isn't for you why do you think you should do this and that fear would overtake me but now what I do I shifted that and I created a new story so when I feel those feelings I tell myself you're excited you're about to go out there and transform someone's life today and now I really do get excited because I know that if I go out and if one person takes what I have to say and they apply it to their life I can make a positive impact so I want you to remember when you get up you start to feel those feelings you have the ability to transform that fear into excitement so if you're still wondering what why should I share my message what impact do I have to make well I want to take you back to 2012 at the time I was giving the biggest talk that I'd given at that point and there was an auditorium full of 200 people and I was ready I knew my message my mission to serve was clear I transformed my fear into excitement and I went out there and I delivered and at the end of the talk a man came up to me and he said Dr. Justin I want to thank you for sharing that message he said I recently underwent quadruple bicepast surgery he said when I was laying in the hospital bed my family they brought in my little grandson and they put my grandson on my lap and he said I looked at my grandson and I made a promise right then and there that I'm going to get my health back because I'm going to be around to watch my grandson grow up and he said what you just shared with me gave me exactly what I needed to get my health back and not only did he go on to get his health back it's 65 years old he completed the Iron Man which is a grueling race which is a 2.4 mile swim a 112 mile bike ride and a complete marathon of 26.2 miles not only has he done one Iron Man he's going on to do multiple Iron Man races and the reason I'm telling you this is because I never would have been able to make a difference in his life if I wouldn't have overcome my fear of public speaking if I wouldn't realized I had a message to share and if I didn't get out and start sharing that message I never would have been able to help him but just like that man they did to hear my message in that moment there is someone that's desperately waiting to hear your message there's a message inside of you that the world needs to hear so I want you to ask yourself what impacts can I make if I overcome my fear of public speaking and I start sharing my message with the world what lives can I touch what legacy can I leave what positive impact can I make in the world I won't leave you with one of my favorite quotes from BJ Palmer he says you never know how far reaching something you may think say or do today will affect the lives of millions tomorrow if you would have told me years ago that one day I was going to be standing on the TEDx stage in this iconic red circle share my message with the world I would have said there's no way but I'm here I did it and if I could overcome my fear of public speaking so can you so my hope is that you'll find your message you'll transform your fear into excitement and you'll go out and you'll start sharing your message with the world and you'll make a positive impact I'm Dr. Justin Mosley thank

" And the captain comes out to greet you and says, Hi, my name's Montana Bonfless. Oh, I'll be your captain for this journey. So, I'm going to the captain's journey. I'm going to the captain's journey. I'm going to the captain's journey. I'm going to the captain's journey. So, oh boy, let's just have a great trip. Sorry. Nope, get me off of this boat. What we want in that moment is for the captain to walk out and say, Hi, my name is Montana Bonfless. I'll be your captain for this journey. Let's have a great trip. The point is, when you are the speaker, you are the captain for that journey. And how you show up really matters. For the last 17 years, I've coached thousands of speakers all over the world from big tech companies to small startups and everyone from new hires to CEOs of Fortune 500 companies want to know, how do you show up and look confident? So, I'd like to share my top five tips for how to be confident, even if you're not. So, let's break it down. What was the difference between those two captains? What did you see? What did you hear? And not just one seemed nervous, one seemed confident, but what was I doing differently to make you think that? Different volume, different words, certainly different body language, but the truth is, I wasn't actually feeling particularly confident. I was just making certain physical and vocal choices to make you think that. You can do that too. Anyone can do this. So, what are those confident-looking choices? Number one, turn up the energy and speak up. When you speak up, even just a little bit, it reads as confident. And you don't have to shout. Think about it this way. On a scale of 1 to 10, aim for a 5. Yes, it goes to 11. But you can just aim for a 5. I'm here at a 5 right now. I can bring it back down to a 3 down here. Nervous captain was down here, and then we bring it back up to a 5. And it sounds prepared, positive, and confident. So, turn up the energy and speak up. Number two, pause. Like a boss. Nervous speakers tend to talk really fast, right? And then when they do have a pause, they fill it in with verbal filler, likes and umbs. However, if you try to speak more slowly, it just sounds like this, right? And that's not better. So, instead, make strategic pauses. Pause in transition. Pause for emphasis. Pause. Like a boss. Number three. Superhero stance. Imagine you are a superhero. You can do it from your chair. How would a superhero sit? Yes. Let that change your posture. I see you. Yes. Let that bring a smile to your face. And have some better eye contact. All of that reads as confident. And pretending to be a superhero is just a super quick way to have confident looking body language. Now, this one also goes to 11. But you can just aim for a five. And that will be great. Tuck in that cape and go save the day. And you can stand in superhero backstage to boost your confidence. But I'm saying bring that superhero stance on stage so that your audience sees you as confident. And if you need an easy shortcut, just make the shape. Just make the shape of a confident person. The audience cannot read your mind. They don't know how you're feeling. So just make the shape and they will go with it. Like, if you came over to my house for dinner and I open up the door and I was like, hi, come on in. We're having chicken. You'd be like, oh, is this a bad time? You know, you've got to make the shape of a good host. Make the smile shape. Right? Instead of cross-arms shape, open up. Hi, welcome. Come on in. If you're not sure, if you're making confident looking choices, you can just video yourself and watch it back. I feel like I just saw you say, hmm, not doing that one. I know most people don't like to watch themselves. I get it, but wouldn't you rather make that adjustment before you're in front of your audience? Yes. Videoing yourself is a great way to check in to see that you're doing the techniques, but also to see that it's still authentically you, your version of Confident Captain. Now, how can you do all of these things on performance day? Number four, practice with purpose. So make yourself a rehearsal schedule. Put it in your calendar. You can give yourself a little treat when you do a run-through and make it practice with purpose by giving yourself a specific goal or layering in one new Confident Captain technique each day. If it's a week before your event, aim to run it all the way through at least once a day. And if you don't have time for a full run-through, just take the opening, closing, run that three times in a row from anywhere. When you're in the shower, and when you're walking your dog, when you're making a meal for your kids, I know my kids are very used to me walking around the house, talking to myself. Whatever you need to do to get in those repetitions, and don't be afraid of over-practice. Don't let that stop you. You can just let go of your verbatim script if it's starting to sound robotic. And you can still use, you know, bullet point speaker notes to remind yourself of what you would like to say and to invite you to say it a little bit differently each time to keep it fresh. And let me be clear, by practice, I mean standing up, saying it out loud, imagining your audience, and inviting them in, clicking through your slides, doing it as much like it will be on the day, whether it's a virtual or in person. And I know it might feel a little funny saying it out loud to yourself. But think about when you learn a new sport, or when you practice a musical instrument. If you had a piano concert on Friday, and you got new music on Monday, would you only read your music every day and then play it for the very first time at the concert on Friday? No way! And yet I see speakers do this all the time. Give yourself a chance. Practice helps everything. And it can really boost your confidence to practice with purpose by layering in one new technique each day. Okay, those first four techniques, they're all about how to appear confident, regardless of how you're feeling. I've got one more technique for you, and it's a big one. But this is the real gem. It's the one that makes all the others shine. This is number five, the silent sentence. This is about what you choose to tell yourself. I've been a professional actor since I was a kid, and I have always loved going on stage as an actor, as a speaker, as an MC, and at the same time, I have often been not just nervous, sometimes downright terrified to step on a stage. I'm shaking, I'm sweating, and I'm like, what was I thinking? Why do I do this to myself? And all these unhelpful voices flood in, and I just tried to make it stop, push it away, and of course that never worked. And I kept going on stage because I love it. And years later, when I became a speaker coach, I got asked to do all these professional presentations, and they went well, but I still had no way to deal with that massive anxiety. And I was like, what can I do? And I thought, well, what am I telling myself? What if you mess up? You better be perfect. I realized I was giving myself an impossible instruction to be perfect. And that really was not working. But what would work? What would be a better message? And to figure that out, I had to go back to square one. What do I want? Why did I say yes to this speaking gig? What is my deeper purpose here? And I realized at the heart of it, I just want to help my audience to the best of my ability. And when I said that, I noticed everything change. That's where I found my first silent sentence. I want to help my audience to the best of my ability. When I said it even silently to myself, it acted like this override switch. I might still be shaking and sweating, but now I have this higher goal, this deeper purpose, and everything aligned to that, and that became my highest priority. I want to help you. And now that thought replaced those unhelpful thoughts, and everything went better in my performance. And I was like, yes, it worked. Yay! And then I was like, wait, how do I do this every time? Especially when the stakes are high. And it dawned on me. Like, if I'm writing and crafting the words I say out loud, why not write and craft the words I say silently to myself? Put it in the script. It's the silent part of the script. So now every time I rehearse, every time I walk on to a stage, every time I join a virtual meeting, I say the following new and evolved silent sentence. I invite you to be here with me while I am here with you so that I can make this easier for you. Now that invitation to myself to be present, that's my definition of stage presence, being present. And that invitation to the audience to be my partner, that reminds me, these are friends, not foes, and I am choosing to be here. And now I'm not just making the shape of a good host. I'm a good host because I am genuinely welcoming you to my world. Now, how do you go about finding your silent sentence? What do you want? What's your deeper purpose? You could be like me, and you might just want to help people. Or it could be something more specific. For example, you might want at least one person in your audience to walk out and make a CPR class. Or maybe you're just super excited to have this experience or share with them some cool solution you have for their problem. You get to fill in the blank and decide what you want to accomplish. And this is not about graduating to some higher level of being where you never again feel nervous. I know I haven't. I'm big, about 15 minutes ago. Well, we're getting ready to walk on this stage. And I am, and probably always will be, a recovering perfectionist. That is a well-worn pathway in my brain. It is there, it exists, it cannot be erased. But now I have this other pathway. And when big moments like this come up, I get to choose. And that's what I was doing back there in the wings. I was choosing to gently insist on repeating my silent sentence to set myself up for success. What we tell ourselves really matters. We follow our own instructions all day long. Our whole selves are always listening. So when you notice something isn't going well, or you're fearing something might not go well in the future, use this checklist. What am I telling myself? What's being broadcast? Then replace that with a better sentence to help set you up for where you'd like to go. And most importantly, put it in the script and practice it. Practice it just as much as the words you say out loud. So if you're running your intro in the shower three times in a row, it would go silent bit, out loud bit, silent, out loud, silent, out loud until it is inextricably linked. And it is just a part of your process. And it is repeatable and reliable. And then it's just there for you when you need it. Now I want to leave you with this final thought. You're at home and you're practicing some of these techniques like turn up the energy and speak up. Pause like a boss. Super hero stance. Practice with purpose. And your silent sentence. Please know that it might feel uncomfortable at first because it's new and that is normal. But think back to when I was demonstrating the nervous captain at the top. How did that make you feel? And then when the confident captain came out, oh, what a relief. Now I can just sit back and enjoy the ride. Remember that feeling of safety you had as an audience member and bring that into your next rehearsal. You can give that gift to your audience. Reach outside your comfort zone to make your audience feel safe by making the choices of a confident captain. And who knows? You might even have fun. Have a great trip.

" Icon Vectors and Icon Values is one of those topics that a lot of students find particularly unintuitive. Things like why are we doing this and what does this actually mean are too often left just floating away in an unanswered sea of computations. And as I've put out the videos of the series, a lot of you have commented about looking forward to visualizing this topic in particular. I suspect that the reason for this is not so much that Icon things are particularly complicated or poorly explained. In fact, it's comparatively straightforward and I think most books do a fine job explaining it. The issue is that it only really makes sense if you have a solid visual understanding for many of the topics that precede it. Most important here is that you know how to think about matrices as linear transformations. But you also need to be comfortable with things like determinants, linear systems of equations, and change of basis. Confusion about eigenstuffs usually has more to do with the shaky foundation in one of these topics than it does with eigenvectors and eigenvalues themselves. To start, consider some linear transformation in two dimensions, like the one shown here. It moves the basis vector i-hat to the coordinates 3e0 and j-hat to 1-2. So it's represented with a matrix whose columns are 3e0 and 1-2. Focus in on what it does to one particular vector and think about the span of that vector, the line passing through its origin and its tip. Most vectors are going to get knocked off their span during the transformation. I mean, it would seem pretty coincidental if the place where the vector landed also happens to be somewhere on that line. But some special vectors do remain on their own span, meaning the effect that the matrix has on such a vector is just to stretch it or squish it, like a scalar. For this specific example, the basis vector i-hat is one such special vector. The span of i-hat is the x-axis, and from the first column of the matrix, we can see that i-hat moves over to 3 times itself, still on that x-axis. What's more, because of the way linear transformations work, any other vector on the x-axis is also just stretched by a factor of 3, and hence remains on its own span. A slightly sneakier vector that remains on its own span during this transformation is negative 1-1. It ends up getting stretched by a factor of 2. And again, linearity is going to imply that any other vector on the diagonal line spanned by this guy is just going to get stretched out by a factor of 2. And for this transformation, those are all the vectors with this special property of staying on their span, those on the x-axis getting stretched out by a factor of 3, and those on this diagonal line getting stretched by a factor of 2. And the other vector is going to get rotated somewhat during the transformation, knocked off the line that it spans. As you might have guessed by now, these special vectors are called the eigenvectors of the transformation, and each eigenvector has associated with it what's called an eigenvalue, which is just the factor by which it's stretched or squished during the transformation. Of course, there's nothing special about stretching versus squishing, or the fact that these eigenvalues happen to be positive. In another example, you could have an eigenvector with eigenvalue negative 1-1-1-1, meaning that the vector gets flipped and squished by a factor of 1-1-1-1-1-1. But the important part here is that it stays on the line that it spans out without getting rotated off of it. For a glimpse of why this might be a useful thing to think about, consider some three-dimensional rotation. If you can find an eigenvector for that rotation, a vector that remains on its own span, what you have found is the axis of rotation. And it's much easier to think about a 3D rotation in terms of some axis of rotation, and an angle by which it's rotating, rather than thinking about the full 3x3 matrix associated with that transformation. In this case, by the way, the corresponding eigenvalue would have to be 1, since rotations never stretch or squish anything, so the length of the vector would remain the same. This pattern shows up a lot in linear algebra. With any linear transformation described by a matrix, you could understand what it's doing by reading off the columns of this matrix as the landing spots for basis vectors. But often, a better way to get at the heart of what the linear transformation actually does, less dependent on your particular coordinate system, is to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. I won't cover the full details on methods for computing eigenvectors and eigenvalues here, but I'll try to give an overview of the computational ideas that are most important for a conceptual understanding. Symbolically, here's what the idea of an eigenvector looks like. A is the matrix representing some transformation with V as the eigenvector, and lambda is a number, namely the corresponding eigenvalue. What this expression is saying is that the matrix vector product A times V gives the same result as just scaling the eigenvector V by some value lambda. So finding the eigenvectors and their eigenvalues of the matrix A comes down to finding the values of V and lambda that make this expression true. It's a little awkward to work with at first because that left-hand side represents matrix vector multiplication, but the right-hand side here is scalar vector multiplication. So let's start by rewriting that right-hand side as some kind of matrix vector multiplication, using a matrix which has the effect of scaling any vector by a factor of lambda. The columns of such a matrix will represent what happens to each basis vector, and each basis vector is simply multiplied by lambda. So this matrix will have the number lambda down the diagonal, with zeros everywhere else. The common way to write this guy is to factor that lambda out, and write it as lambda times i, where i is the identity matrix with ones down the diagonal. With both sides looking like matrix vector multiplication, we can subtract off that right-hand side and factor out the V. So what we now have is a new matrix, A minus lambda times the identity, and we're looking for a vector V such that this new matrix, times V, gives the zero vector. Now this will always be true if V itself is the zero vector, but that's boring. What we want is a non-zero eigenvector. And if you watch chapter 5 and 6, you'll know that the only way it's possible for the product of a matrix with a non-zero vector to become zero is if the transformation associated with that matrix squishes space into a lower dimension. And that squishification corresponds to a zero determinant for the matrix. To be concrete, let's say your matrix A has columns 2, 1, and 2, 3. And think about subtracting off a variable amount lambda from each diagonal entry. Now imagine tweaking lambda, turning a knob to change its value. As that value of lambda changes, the matrix itself changes, and so the determinant of the matrix changes. The goal here is to find a value of lambda that will make this determinant zero, meaning the tweaked transformation squishes space into a lower dimension. In this case, the sweet spot comes when lambda equals 1. Of course, if we had chosen some other matrix, the eigenvalue might not necessarily be 1, the sweet spot might be hit at some other value of lambda. So this is kind of a lot, but let's unravel what this is saying. When lambda equals 1, the matrix A minus lambda times the identity squishes space onto a line. That means there's a non-zero vector v such that A minus lambda times the identity times v equals the zero vector. And remember, the reason we care about that is because it means A times v equals lambda times v, which you can read off as saying that the vector v is an eigenvector of A, staying on its own span during the transformation A. In this example, the corresponding eigenvalue is 1, so v would actually just stay fixed in place. Pause and ponder if you need to make sure that that line of reasoning feels good. This is the kind of thing I mentioned in the introduction. If you didn't have a solid grasp of determinants and why they relate to linear systems of equations having non-zero solutions, an expression like this would feel completely out of the blue. To see this in action, let's revisit the example from the start, with a matrix whose columns are 3, 0 and 1, 2. To find if a value lambda is an eigenvalue, subtract it from the diagonals of this matrix and compute the determinant. Doing this, we get a certain quadratic polynomial in lambda, 3 minus lambda times 2 minus lambda. Since lambda can only be an eigenvalue if this determinant happens to be zero, you can conclude that the only possible eigenvalues are lambda equals 2 and lambda equals 3. To figure out what the eigenvectors are that actually have one of these eigenvalues, say lambda equals 2, plug in that value of lambda to the matrix and then solve for which vectors this diagonally altered matrix sends to zero. If you computed this the way you would any other linear system, you'd see that the solutions are all the vectors on the diagonal line spanned by negative 1, 1. This corresponds to the fact that the unaltered matrix, 3, 0, 1, 2, has the effect of stretching all those vectors by a factor of 2. Now a 2D transformation doesn't have to have eigenvectors. For example, consider a rotation by 90 degrees. This doesn't have any eigenvectors since it rotates every vector off of its own span. If you actually try computing the eigenvalues of a rotation like this, notice what happens. Its matrix has columns 0, 1 and negative 1, 0. Subtract off lambda from the diagonal elements and look for when the determinant is 0. In this case, you get the polynomial lambda squared plus 1. The only roots of that polynomial are the imaginary numbers, i and negative i. The fact that there are no real number solutions indicates that there are no eigenvectors. Another pretty interesting example worth holding in the back of your mind is a shear. This fixes i hat and place and moves j hat 1 over, so its matrix has columns 1, 0 and 1, 1. All of the vectors on the x-axis are eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1 since they remain fixed in place. In fact, these are the only eigenvectors. When you subtract off lambda from the diagonals and compute the determinant, what you get is 1 minus lambda squared. And the only root of this expression is lambda equals 1. This lines up with what we see geometrically that all of the eigenvectors have eigenvalue 1. Keep in mind though, it's also possible to have just one eigenvalue, but with more than just a line full of eigenvectors. A simple example is a matrix that scales everything by 2. The only eigenvalue is 2, but every vector in the plane gets to be an eigenvector with that eigenvalue. Now is another good time to pause and ponder some of this before I move on to the last topic. I want to finish off here with the idea of an eigenbasis, which relies heavily on ideas from the last video. Take a look at what happens if our basis vectors just so happen to be eigenvectors. For example, maybe i-hat is scaled by negative 1 and j-hat is scaled by 2. Taking their new coordinates as the columns of a matrix, notice that those scalar multiples negative 1 and 2, which are the eigenvalues of i-hat and j-hat, sit on the diagonal of our matrix, and every other entry is a 0. Anytime a matrix has zeroes everywhere other than the diagonal, it's called, reasonably enough, a diagonal matrix. And the way to interpret this is that all the basis vectors are eigenvectors, with the diagonal entries of this matrix being their eigenvalues. There are a lot of things that make diagonal matrices much nicer to work with. One big one is that it's easier to compute what will happen if you multiply this matrix by itself a whole bunch of times. Since all one of these matrices does is scale each basis vector by some eigenvalue, applying that matrix many times, say 100 times, is just going to correspond to scaling each basis vector by the 100th power of the corresponding eigenvalue. In contrast, try computing the 100th power of a non-diagonal matrix. Really, try it for a moment. It's a nightmare. Of course, you'll rarely be so lucky as to have your basis vectors also be eigenvectors. But if your transformation has a lot of eigenvectors, like the one from the start of this video, enough so that you can choose a set that spans the full space, then you could change your coordinate system so that these eigenvectors are your basis vectors. I talked about change of basis last video, but I'll go through a super quick reminder here of how to express a transformation currently written in our coordinate system into a different system. Take the coordinates of the vectors that you want to use as a new basis, which in this case means our two eigenvectors that make those coordinates the columns of a matrix, known as the change of basis matrix. When you sandwich the original transformation, putting the change of basis matrix on its right, and the inverse of the change of basis matrix on its left, the result will be a matrix representing that same transformation, but from the perspective of the new basis vectors coordinate system. The whole point of doing this with eigenvectors is that this new matrix is guaranteed to be diagonal, with its corresponding eigenvalues down that diagonal. This is because it represents working in a coordinate system, where what happens to the basis vectors is that they get scaled during the transformation. A set of basis vectors, which are also eigenvectors, is called, again, reasonably enough, an eigen basis. So if, for example, you needed to compute the 100th power of this matrix, it would be much easier to change to an eigenbasis, compute the 100th power in that system, then convert back to our standard system. You can't do this with all transformations. A shear, for example, doesn't have enough eigenvectors to span the full space. But if you can find an eigenbasis, it makes matrix operations really lovely. For those of you willing to work through a pretty neat puzzle to see what this looks like in action, and how it can be used to produce some surprising results, I'll leave up a prompt here on the screen. It takes a bit of work, but I think you'll enjoy it. The next and final video of this series is going to be on abstract vector spaces.

" This is a 3. It's slobily written and rendered at an extremely low resolution of 28x28 pixels, but your brain has no trouble recognizing it as a 3. And I want you to take a moment to appreciate how crazy it is that brains can do this so effortlessly. I mean this, this and this are also recognizable as 3s, even though the specific values of each pixel is very different from one image to the next. The particular light-sensitive cells in your eye that are firing when you see this 3 are very different from the ones firing when you see this 3. But something in that crazy smart visual cortex of yours resolves these as representing the same idea, while at the same time recognizing other images as their own distinct ideas. But if I told you, hey, sit down and write for me a program that takes in a grid of 28x28 pixels like this, and outputs a single number between 0 and 10, telling you what it thinks the digit is, while the task goes from comically trivial to dauntingly difficult. Unless you've been living under a rock, I think I hardly need to motivate the relevance and importance of machine learning and neural networks to the present and to the future. But what I want to do here is show you what a neural network actually is, assuming no background, and to help visualize what it's doing. Not as a buzzword, but as a piece of math. My hope is just that you come away feeling like the structure itself is motivated, and to feel like you know what it means when you read, or you hear about a neural network quote unquote learning. This video is just going to be devoted to the structure component of that, and the following one is going to tackle learning. What we're going to do is put together a neural network that can learn to recognize handwritten digits. This is a somewhat classic example for introducing the topic, and I'm happy to stick with the status quote here, because at the end of the two videos, I want to point you to a couple good resources where you can learn more, and where you can download the code that does this and play with it on your own computer. There are many, many variants of neural networks, and in recent years there's been sort of a boom in research towards these variants, but in these two introductory videos, you and I are just going to look at the simplest plain vanilla form with no added frills. This is kind of a necessary prerequisite for understanding any of the more powerful modern variants, and trust me, it still has plenty of complexity for us to wrap our minds around. But even in this simplest form, it can learn to recognize handwritten digits, which is a pretty cool thing for a computer to be able to do. And at the same time, you'll see how it does fall short of a couple hopes that we might have for it. As the name suggests, neural networks are inspired by the brain, but let's break that down. What are the neurons and in what sense are they linked together? Right now, when I say neuron, all I want you to think about is a thing that holds a number, specifically a number between zero and one. It's really not more than that. For example, the network starts with a bunch of neurons corresponding to each of the 28 times 28 pixels of the input image, which is 784 neurons in total. Each one of these holds a number that represents the gray scale value of the corresponding pixel, ranging from zero for black pixels up to one for white pixels. This number inside the neuron is called its activation. And the image you might have in mind here is that each neuron is lit up when its activation is a high number. So all of these 784 neurons make up the first layer of our network. Now jumping over to the last layer, this has 10 neurons each representing one of the digits. The activation in these neurons, again, some number that's between zero and one, represents how much the system thinks that a given image corresponds with a given digit. There's also a couple layers in between called the hidden layers, which for the time being, should just be a giant question mark. For how on earth this process of recognizing digits is going to be handled. In this network, I chose two hidden layers, each one with 16 neurons. And admittedly, that's kind of an arbitrary choice. To be honest, I chose two layers based on how I want to motivate the structure in just a moment. And 16, well, that was just a nice number to fit on the screen. In practice, there is a lot of room for experiment with a specific structure here. The way the network operates, activations in one layer determine the activations of the next layer. And of course, the heart of the network, as an information processing mechanism, comes down to exactly how those activations from one layer bring about activations in the next layer. It's meant to be loosely analogous to how in biological networks of neurons, some groups of neurons firing cause certain others to fire. Now, the network I'm showing here has already been trained to recognize digits. And let me show you what I mean by that. It means if you feed in an image, lighting up all 784 neurons of the input layer, according to the brightness of each pixel in the image, that pattern of activations causes some very specific pattern in the next layer, which causes some pattern in the one after it, which finally gives some pattern in the output layer. And the brightest neuron of that output layer is the network's choice, so to speak, for what digit this image represents. And before jumping into the math for how one layer influences the next or how training works, let's just talk about why it's even reasonable to expect a layered structure like this to behave intelligently. What are we expecting here? What is the best hope for what those middle layers might be doing? Well, when you or I recognize digits, we piece together various components. A 9 has a loop up top and a line on the right. And 8 also has a loop up top, but it's paired with another loop down low. A 4 basically breaks down into 3 specific lines and things like that. Now in a perfect world, we might hope that each neuron in the second to last layer corresponds with one of these subcomponents. That anytime you feed in an image with, say, a loop up top, like a 9 or an 8, there's some specific neuron whose activation is going to be close to 1. And I don't mean this specific loop of pixels. The hope would be that any generally loopy pattern towards the top sets off this neuron. That way, going from the third layer to the last one, just requires learning which combination of subcomponents corresponds to which digits. Of course, that just kicks the problem down the road because how would you recognize these sub components or even learn what the right subcomponents should be? And I still haven't even talked about how one layer influences the next, but run with me on this one for a moment. Recognizing a loop can also break down into subproblems. One reasonable way to do this would be to first recognize the various little edges that make it up. Similarly, a long line, like the kind you might see in the digits 1 or 4 or 7, well that's really just a long edge, or maybe you think of it as a certain pattern of several smaller edges. So maybe, our hope is that each neuron in the second layer of the network corresponds with the various relevant little edges. Maybe, when an image like this one comes in, it lights up all of the neurons associated with around 8 to 10 specific little edges, which in turn lights up the neurons associated with the upper loop and a long vertical line, and those light up the neuron associated with the 9. Whether or not this is what our final network actually does is another question, one that I'll come back to once we see how to train the network. But this is a hope that we might have, a sort of goal with the layered structure like this. Moreover, you can imagine how being able to detect edges and patterns like this would be really useful for other image recognition tasks. And even beyond image recognition, there are all sorts of intelligent things you might want to do that break down into layers of abstraction. Parsing speech, for example, involves taking raw audio and picking out distinct sounds, which combine to make certain syllables, which combine to form words, which combine to make up phrases and more abstract thoughts, etc. But getting back to how any of this actually works, picture yourself right now designing how exactly the activations in one layer might determine the activations in the next. The goal is to have some mechanism that could conceivably combine pixels into edges, or edges into patterns, or patterns into digits. And to zoom in on one very specific example, let's say the hope is for one particular neuron in the second layer to pick up on whether or not the image has an edge in this region here. The question at hand is what parameters should the network have? What dials and knobs should you be able to tweak so that it's expressive enough to potentially capture this pattern, or any other pixel pattern, or the pattern that several edges can make a loop and other such things? Well, what we'll do is assign a weight to each one of the connections between our neuron and the neurons from the first layer. These weights are just numbers. Then take all of those activations from the first layer and compute their weighted sum according to these weights. I find it helpful to think of these weights as being organized into a little grid of their own, and I'm going to use green pixels to indicate positive weights and red pixels to indicate negative weights, where the brightness of that pixel is some loose depiction of the weights value. Now if we made the weights associated with almost all of the pixels zero, except for some positive weights in this region that we care about, then taking the weighted sum of all the pixel values really just amounts to adding up the values of the pixel just in the region that we care about. And if you really wanted to pick up on whether there's an edge here, what you might do is have some negative weights associated with the surrounding pixels. Then the sum is largest when those middle pixels are bright, but the surrounding pixels are darker. When you compute a weighted sum like this, you might come out with any number, but for this network, what we want is for activations to be some value between zero and one. So a common thing to do is to pump this weighted sum into some function that squishes the real number line into the range between zero and one. And a common function that does this is called the sigmoid function, also known as a logistic curve, basically very negative inputs end up close to zero, very positive inputs end up close to one, and it just steadily increases around the input zero. So the activation of the neuron here is basically a measure of how positive the relevant weighted sum is. But maybe it's not that you want the neuron to light up when the weighted sum is bigger than zero. Maybe you only want it to be active when the sum is bigger than say 10. That is, you want some bias for it to be inactive. What we'll do then is just add in some other number, like negative 10, to this weighted sum, before plugging it through the sigmoid squishing function. That additional number is called the bias. So the weights tell you what pixel pattern this neuron in the second layer is picking up on, and the bias tells you how high the weighted sum needs to be before the neuron starts getting meaningfully active. And that is just one neuron. Every other neuron in this layer is going to be connected to all 784 pixel neurons from the first layer, and each one of those 784 connections has its own weight associated with it. Also, each one has some bias, some other number that you add onto the weighted sum before squishing it with the sigmoid. And that's a lot to think about. With this hidden layer of 16 neurons, that's a total of 784 x 16 weights, along with 16 biases. And all of that is just the connections from the first layer to the second. The connections between the other layers also have a bunch of weights and biases associated with them. All said and done, this network has almost exactly 13,000 total weights and biases. 13,000 knobs and dials that can be tweaked and turned to make this network behave in different ways. So when we talk about learning, what that's referring to is getting the computer to find a valid setting for all of these many, many numbers so that it'll actually solve the problem at hand. One thought experiment that is at once fun and kind of horrifying is to imagine sitting down and setting all of these weights and biases by hand, purposefully tweaking the numbers so that the second layer picks up on edges, the third layer picks up on patterns, etc. I personally find this satisfying rather than just treating the network as a total black box because when the network doesn't perform the way you anticipate, if you've built up a little bit of a relationship with what those weights and biases actually mean, you have a starting place for experimenting with how to change the structure to improve. Or when the network does work but not for the reasons you might expect, digging into what the weights and biases are doing is a good way to challenge your assumptions and really expose the full space of possible solutions. By the way, the actual function here is a little cumbersome to write down, don't you think? So let me show you a more notationally compact way that these connections are represented. This is how you'd see it if you choose to read out more about neural networks. Organize all of the activations from one layer into a column as a vector. Then organize all of the weights as a matrix, where each row of that matrix corresponds to the connections between one layer and a particular neuron in the next layer. What that means is that taking the weighted sum of the activations in the first layer, according to these weights, corresponds to one of the terms in the matrix vector product of everything we have on the left here. By the way, so much of machine learning just comes down to having a good grasp of linear algebra. So for any of you who want a nice visual understanding for matrices and what matrix vector multiplication means, take a look at the series I did on linear algebra, especially chapter 3. Back to our expression, instead of talking about adding the bias to each one of these values independently, we represent it by organizing all those biases into a vector and adding the entire vector to the previous matrix vector product. Then as a final step, I'll wrap a sigmoid around the outside here. And what that's supposed to represent is that you're going to apply the sigmoid function to each specific component of the resulting vector inside. So once you write down this weight matrix and these vectors as their own symbols, you can communicate the full transition of activations from one layer to the next in an extremely tight and neat little expression. And this makes the relevant code both a lot simpler and a lot faster since many libraries optimize the heck out of matrix multiplication. Remember how earlier I said these neurons are simply things that hold numbers? Well, of course the specific numbers that they hold depends on the image you feed in. So it's actually more accurate to think of each neuron as a function, one that takes in the outputs of all the neurons in the previous layer and spits out a number between 0 and 1. Really, the entire network is just a function, one that takes in 784 numbers as an input and spits out 10 numbers as an output. It's an absurdly complicated function, one that involves 13,000 parameters in the forms of these weights and biases that pick up on certain patterns and which involves iterating many matrix vector products and the sigmoid squishification function. But it's just a function nonetheless. And in a way, it's kind of reassuring that it looks complicated. I mean, if there were any simpler, what hope would we have that it could take on the challenge of recognizing digits? And how does it take on that challenge? How does this network learn the appropriate weights and biases just by looking at data? Oh, that's what I'll show in the next video. And I'll also dig a little more into what this particular network we're seeing is really doing. Now is the point I suppose I should say subscribe to stay notified about when that video or any new videos come out, but realistically, most of you don't actually receive notifications from YouTube, do you? Maybe more honestly, I should say subscribe so that the neural networks that underlie YouTube's recommendation algorithm are primed to believe that you want to see content from this channel get recommended to you.

I've been a little slow to progress in the probability series this summer, but I'm jumping back into it after this project, so patrons you can look out for updates there. To close things off here, I have with me, Lisa Lee, who did her PhD work on the theoretical side of deep learning and who currently works at a venture capital firm called Amplify Partners, who kindly provided some of the funding for this video. So, Lisa, one thing I think we should quickly bring up is this sigmoid function. As I understand it, early networks use this to squish the relevant weighted sum into that interval between zero and one, you know, kind of motivated by this biological analogy of neurons either being inactive or active. Exactly. But relatively few modern networks actually use sigmoid anymore. Yeah. It's kind of old school, right? Yeah, or rather, relu seems to be much easier to train. And relu stands for rectified linear unit? Yes, it's this kind of function where you're just taking a max of zero and A, where A is given by what you were explaining in the video. And what this was sort of motivated from, I think, was a partially biobiological analogy with how neurons would either be activated or not. And so if it passes a certain threshold, it would be the identity function. But if it did not, then it would just not be activated, so it'd be zero. So it's kind of a simplification. Using sigmoids didn't help training, or it was very difficult to train at some point and people just tried relu and it happened to work very well for these incredibly deep neural networks. All right.
